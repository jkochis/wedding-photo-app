# ✅ GCS Setup Complete!

## Summary

Your Google Cloud Storage is configured and ready:

- **Project**: group-image-share-473717
- **Bucket**: group-image-share  
- **Service Account**: wedding-photo-uploader@group-image-share-473717.iam.gserviceaccount.com
- **Key File**: config/gcs-key.json ✅
- **Connection**: Tested and working ✅
- **Local `.env`**: Updated ✅

## What's Been Done

1. ✅ Service account created with proper permissions
2. ✅ Credentials downloaded to `config/gcs-key.json`
3. ✅ `.env` updated with correct bucket/project
4. ✅ Connection tested successfully
5. ✅ Storage adapter modules ready (`server/storage/`)

## To Complete Integration

I need to update `server/index.cjs` to use GCS. The changes are:

1. Import storage adapter
2. Change multer to memory storage
3. Update upload handler to save via storage adapter
4. Update delete handler to use storage adapter
5. Update clear-all handler to use storage adapter

Due to message length, would you like me to:

A) Create the updated `server/index.cjs` file
B) Give you the specific code changes to apply manually
C) Create a Git patch file you can apply

Just let me know which approach you prefer!
